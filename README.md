Jurassic Park Security Database

Andrew Osborne & Conner Patzman

Project Overview

InGen currently projects $2.4B/year in revenue from its Isla Nublar Jurassic Park tourist destination featuring genetically engineered dinosaurs. When developing the cloning technology necessary to bring dinosaurs back from extinction, InGen realized that in order to have a park with real dinosaurs, a state of the art security system would be necessary. By carefully monitoring the location of all animals and humans present on the island, the system can serve three important purposes: 1) ensuring that the park is safe for visitors, 2) preventing corporate espionage, and 3) aiding in the management of the parkâ€™s stock of animals.

A state of the art computer system ensures the safety and integrity of the park with a massive network of cameras that covers every inch of the island. This allows the computer system to maintain an accurate count of all dinosaurs and people. A database driven website is used to record all dinosaurs. The status of each dinosaur, including species, location, and status is recorded. In addition, the database keeps track of each employee (location, job title, status) as well as notable visitors (Ian Malcolm, Laura Hardy, etc).
